# Huffman-Tree-Encoding
This program takes a text file of anything characters you want, encodes them using a huffman tree algorithm and then decodes them.

How to Run:
  python3 huffman.py (text file name)
  
Key Notes: 
  This program produces an optimal huffman tree. Produces a encoded text file and produces a encoded_decode text file. You can see the encoding and if the program properly encoded/decoded the file.
  The only functions I wrote were huffman_letter_codes_from_file_contents(), huffman_codes_from_frequencies(), H_T_C(), and file_character_frequencies()
